# AsteroidsGame-WebApp-JavaScript
 Designed and developed a fully interactive Asteroids game (1979 Atari game) using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas API, achieving smooth 60 FPS gameplay with realistic physics, dynamic sound effects, and music. Developed ship movement, asteroid destruction, and laser physics, ensuring accurate collision detection and seamless edge wrapping. Optimized performance by managing game loops effectively and reducing unnecessary calculations, allowing for responsive controls and a progressively challenging difficulty curve. Implemented persistent high score tracking using local storage, allowing scores to remain across page refreshes, with a manual reset function triggered by the 'R' key.
